# Dungeon-Crawl

A text-based dungeon crawl style game written in C++. Designed and created for a university project to practice object oriented programming concepts.

As the player, you have the option to choose between one of two classes, and begin to explore the seemingly infinite dungeon, fighting monsters along the way.

The files include a Makefile to assist with compilation as well as some additional files & Makefile scripts that were used to test the program during its development.
